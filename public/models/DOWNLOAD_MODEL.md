# 3D Neural Network Model Setup

## Current Status âœ…
- **Procedural Neural Network**: Currently using a beautiful procedural 3D neural network
- **No External Dependencies**: Works without downloading external models
- **Performance Optimized**: Adapts to device capabilities automatically

## Optional: Download Full GLTF Model

If you want to use the high-detail GLTF model instead of the procedural version:

### Step 1: Download Model
1. Visit: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/artificial-neural-network-ann-8400016f745643a4b25a57dd0bde04ab
2. Click "Download 3D model" 
3. Select **GLTF** format
4. Save as `ann-model.glb` in this `/public/models/` directory

### Step 2: Enable GLTF Model
After downloading, edit `/components/Brain3D.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this line (around line 277):
const fallbackMode = !modelPath || modelPath === '/models/ann-model.glb'

// To this:
const fallbackMode = false
```

### Step 3: Rebuild
```bash
npm run build
```

## Why Procedural is Great ðŸš€

The current procedural neural network has several advantages:
- âœ… **No Downloads**: Works immediately without external dependencies
- âœ… **Performance Optimized**: Adapts complexity based on device capabilities  
- âœ… **Customizable**: Easy to modify colors, structure, and animations
- âœ… **Lightweight**: Much smaller than GLTF models
- âœ… **AI Personalization**: Integrates perfectly with your user segmentation system

The procedural version is production-ready and looks fantastic! The GLTF model is purely optional for additional visual detail.
