- All three sections must have EXACTLY the same border width (80 characters total)
- Use `+` and `=` characters for borders with mathematical precision
- Include emojis and visual indicators for maximum impact

**AI Development Tips System:**
- Create 30+ AI development tips like "ðŸ¤– Optimize your ML pipeline", "âš¡ Implement proper error handling", "ðŸ§  Use transfer learning for better results"
- Tips should rotate every 10 seconds
- Each tip gets its own perfectly-sized bordered box
- Include scrolling indicators and live update animations

**Technical Implementation:**
- Read Claude Code session data via JSON input
